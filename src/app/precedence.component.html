<h2>{{title}}</h2>

<p>Basic uppercase pipe (no precedence considerations necessary): {{ 'text' | uppercase }}</p>
<p>The following shows that a pipe has higher precedence than a ternary operator. If the pipe precedence were lower than the ternary operator precedence, the output would be in uppercase as in 'TRUE'. Instead "true" is lowercase: {{ true ? 'true' : 'false' | uppercase }}</p>
<p>The following shows how parentheses help Angular evaluate the whole statement:
<!-- use parentheses in the third operand so the pipe applies to the whole expression -->
{{ (true ? 'true' : 'false') | uppercase }}
</p>
